## Overview

We will set up the infrastructure for a Python Flask web application on Google Cloud using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform. The application will display "Hello World" and fetch this message from a Cloud SQL database. Follow these steps to get started:

### 1. **Google Cloud Account Setup**

1. **Create a Google Cloud Account**:
   - Sign up at [Google Cloud Free Tier](https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier).

2. **Install Required Tools**:
   - **Python 3**: Required for developing the web application.
   - **gcloud CLI**: Interface for interacting with Google Cloud services.
   - **Terraform**: For coding infrastructure. Install it from [Terraform’s installation guide](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli).

### 2. **Configure Google Cloud Environment**

1. **Create a Billing Account**:
   - Set up a billing account in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing).

2. **Set Up Your Project Directory**:
   - Create a directory for your project using VSCode or your preferred editor.

### 3. **Infrastructure Code**

1. **Project and Database Setup**:
   - Write Terraform code to create a Google Cloud Project, Cloud SQL database, VPC, and enable monitoring.
   - The `gcp-projects` folder manages dynamic project creation. Specify the billing account and deployment region.
   - Import the `gcp-projects` module into `main.tf` to handle dynamic project creation. Configure details using `variables.tf`.

2. **Database Configuration**:
   - Set up a Cloud SQL database (MySQL 5.7) with a private IP.
   - Define database credentials and permissions in `cloudsql.tf`.
   - Store DB credentials (host, username, password, database name) as secrets in `main.tf`.

3. **Network Setup**:
   - Define the VPC with firewall rules, network/subnetwork configuration, and router details in `networking.tf`.

4. **Load Balancer Configuration**:
   - Create an Application Load Balancer in `lb.tf` to distribute traffic using round-robin. Configure it to listen on port 80 for the Flask app.

5. **Compute Engine Setup**:
   - Use a Google Compute Engine (GCE) instance template to host the Flask app.
   - Specify machine type, disk details, and the startup script in your Terraform configuration.
   - **Startup Script**: Located in `scripts/startup.sh`. This script installs necessary software, fetches the Python application from [GitHub](https://github.com/sonamawachar0110/iddotmepython.git), sets up environment variables, retrieves secrets from Google Secret Manager, and configures the app.

6. **Monitoring**:
   - Define monitoring metrics such as CPU load, memory load, request rate, response times, and error rate in `monitoring.tf`.
   - Create alert policies specifying thresholds, alert expressions, and notification channels (e.g., email, Slack, PagerDuty).

### 4. **Deploying the Flask Application**

1. **Prepare Environment Variables**:
   - Export necessary variables:
     ```sh
     export TF_VAR_org_id=$(gcloud organizations list --format=json | jq -r '.[0].name' | cut -d'/' -f2)
     export TF_VAR_billing_account=$(gcloud beta billing accounts list --format=json | jq -r '.[0].name' | cut -d'/' -f2)
     ```
   - Log in to Google Cloud:
     ```sh
     gcloud auth application-default login
     ```

2. **Run Terraform Commands**:
   - Initialize Terraform:
     ```sh
     terraform init
     ```
   - Plan and apply changes:
     ```sh
     terraform plan
     terraform apply
     ```

3. **Access the Application**:
   - After applying changes, go to Google Cloud -> Network Services -> Load Balancer to get the IP address.
   - Paste the IP address into your browser to view the application loading data from the database.

### 5. **Automation and Best Practices**

1. **Dynamic Region Selection**:
   - Configure the deployment region dynamically in Terraform instead of hardcoding.

2. **Automate Billing Account Management**:
   - Use Terraform to automate billing account creation.

3. **Modularize Terraform Code**:
   - Use modules for better management and reusability of Terraform code.

4. **Manage Secrets**:
   - Store and manage secrets separately in `secret.tf` using Google Secret Manager.

5. **Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana**:
   - Set up monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana.

6. **Create SLO/SLA Dashboards**:
   - Define and agree upon SLIs with stakeholders for SLO/SLA dashboards.

7. **Use Artifact Registry**:
   - Use Google Artifact Registry instead of Google Container Registry for Docker image storage.

8. **Set Up DNS**:
   - Create DNS records instead of exposing direct IP addresses.

9. **Generalize Project Setup**:
   - Develop generalized scripts for loading projects into different environments.

10. **Create Multiple Environments**:
    - Set up different environments such as development, testing, staging, and production.

This approach ensures a structured setup of the infrastructure and application deployment on Google Cloud, following best practices for automation and configuration management.
